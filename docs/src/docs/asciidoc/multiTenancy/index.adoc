== Multi-Tenancy
GORM for MongoDb supports the following multi-tenancy modes:

* `DATABASE` - A separate database with a separate connection pool is used to store each tenants data.
* `SCHEMA` - The same database, but different schemas are used to store each tenants data.
* `DISCRIMINATOR` - The same database is used with a discriminator used to partition and isolate data.
