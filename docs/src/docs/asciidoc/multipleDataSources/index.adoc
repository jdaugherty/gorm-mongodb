== Multiple Data Sources
GORM for MongoDB supports the notion of multiple data sources where multiple individual `MongoClient` instances can be configured and switched between.

=== The ConnectionSources API

Introduced in GORM 6.0, the link:../api/org/grails/datastore/mapping/core/connections/ConnectionSources.html[ConnectionSources] API allows you to introspect the data sources configured for the application:

[source,groovy]
----
@Autowired
MongoDatastore mongoDatastore
...
ConnectionSources<MongoClient, MongoConnectionSourceSettings> connectionSources
					= mongoDatastore.getConnectionSources()

for(ConnectionSource<MongoClient, MongoConnectionSourceSettings> connectionSource in connectionSources) {
	println "Name $connectionSource.name"
	MongoClient mongoClient = connectionSource.source
}
